<h2 class="item2">Prepare</h2>

<h6>Before you proceed to setting up your OpenCart Web site, please make sure you are fully prepared. </h6>

<h4>Software</h4>

<p>To feel comfortable working with the OpenCart template, we recommend downloading all the applications required. You
    can see the list of required software at the template live demo page. The requirements may vary for different
    templates, so we'll tell you here what is needed in general:</p>

<ol class="index-list">
    <li> You may need the Adobe Photoshop application. It is used to edit .PSD source files and it is necessary if you
        want to edit template design graphics and images.
    </li>
    <li>To edit template source code files, you need some code editor like Adobe Dreamweaver, Notepad++, Sublime Text,
        etc.
    </li>
    <li>To upload files to the hosting server, you may need an FTP Manager like Total Commander, FileZilla, CuteFTP,
        etc.
    </li>
    <li>Proceed with the following guide to unzip the archives, using
        <a href="/help/extract-archived-files-windows-os.html" target="_blank"> WinZip(PC)</a> and
        <a href="/help/extract-archived-files-mac-os.html" target="_blank"> StuffitExpander(MAC)</a>.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Hosting</h4>

<p>As OpenCart engine is a PHP/MySQL based application, you need to prepare a hosting environment. </p>

<p>If you have live hosting, please make sure it matches
    <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/requirements/"
       target="_blank">OpenCart system requirements
    </a>
    and is
    ready to be used for OpenCart websites.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can run OpenCart locally on your computer using the local server. To create a local hosting
    server, please use the localhost applications such as <b>WAMP</b>, <b>AppServ</b>, <b>MAMP</b>, etc. Any of those
    can be easily installed as any other program and used to run OpenCart.
</p>

<p>Please check the tutorials below on how to configure the local development environment:</p>
