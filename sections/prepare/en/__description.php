<h4>Hosting</h4>

<p>As OpenCart engine is a PHP/MySQL based application, you need to prepare a hosting environment. </p>

<p>If you have live hosting, please make sure it matches
    <a href="http://docs.opencart.com/requirements/"
       target="_blank">OpenCart system requirements
    </a>
    and is
    ready to be used for OpenCart websites.
</p>

<p align="justify">You can run Joomla locally (on your computer) using the local server. To create a local hosting server, please use localhost applications, such as <b>WAMP</b>, <b>AppServ</b>, <b>MAMP</b>, etc. Any of those can be easily installed as any other software and be used to run OpenCart.</p>
<p>Please check the tutorials below on how to configure the local development environment:</p>

<h4>System Requirements</h4>

<p>These extensions must be enabled for OpenCart to install properly on the web server.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web Server (Apache suggested)</li>
  <li>PHP 5.4+(1.5.x at least 5.2+)</li>
  <li>Database (MySQLi suggested)</li>
</ul>
